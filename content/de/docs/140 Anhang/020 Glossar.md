|Begriff oder Akronym|Term or Acronym|Erläuterung|
|:----|:----|:----|
|Buchhaltungscode|Accounting code|A reference number used to identify a vendor in an external payment system.|
|Erwerbungsteam|Acquisition unit|An additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restricts a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. For example, you may create acquisition units to represent the different libraries within your library system. Units are defined and determined by your library in the Settings app.|
| |Allocated fund|A fund that has been assigned a monetary value for the fiscal year and therefore has money to spend.|
| |Analytic|An analytic is a portion of a work (like a volume in a series) that can be described separately from the work itself. Analytics can be created for articles in a journal, volumes of a monograph, or issues of a serial|
|Verfügbarkeit|Availability|The status of an item in terms of circulation (for example, available; recently returned). In FOLIO, "Item Status" displays availability.|
| |Batch group|Invoices grouped together for export to an external accounts payable system. Invoices from the same library are generally processed together, as determined by the batch group assignment on each invoice.|
| |Bound-with|Multiple, separate bibliographic titles that are bound together in a single volume, most frequently by a former owner but also sometimes by a publisher and for other reasons.|
|Budget|Budget|A finance record that describes the amount of money available for a fiscal year within a fund that includes a definition of the allowed expenditure percentage and allowed encumbrance percentage. Transfers and allocations transactions are performed against a budget. Expense classes can be assigned to a budget.|
|Bug|Bug|An error, fault or flaw in a software system.|
| |Campus|The second level of the four level location structure (Institution -> Campus -> Library -> Location). The structure is hierarchical - a campus must be linked to one institution, and a library must be linked to one campus.|
| |Child record|Associated with linking bound-withs, which allows for "links" between separate bibliographic records and/or a bibliographic record and items belonging to another bibliographic record. Child records are those associated bibliographic records.|
|CQL|CQL|Contextual Query Language. A formal language for representing queries to Information Retrieval systems such as web indexes, bibliographic catalogues and museum collection information.|
| |CRUD|Create, Read, Update, Delete. The basic actions that can be taken on a record in a software system.|

| |Expense class|A fiscal entity used to track transactions against a specific purpose or function within a Fund.|
| |Item effective location|FOLIO has permanent and temporary location fields on the Holdings and Items records. There is built-in logic for FOLIO to compute the item's "effective location" based on what values are set.|
|eHoldings|eHoldings|Contains information such as the resource’s URL, call number, etc to enable staff to locate and manage library electronic holdings.|
| |Encumbrance|An amount of money that the library commits to pay to a vendor from a fund budget for ordered materials that will be invoiced in the future.|

| |Mode of issuance|The abstract form of the resource (eg., monograph, subunit).|
| |Net transfers|Money transferred between funds during a fiscal year.|
|Okapi|Okapi|Okapi is the FOLIO-provided gateway system for managing apps and communication between system modules. System administrators and hosting providers use Okapi as an essential tool to manage FOLIO performance, upgrade or remove modules, and maintain available permissions. In contrast, library staff generally only use Okapi when they need to query FOLIO APIs for information. See https://github.com/folio-org/okapi/blob/master/doc/guide.md for more detailed technical documentation.|
| |Order|A purchase order featuring a list of titles or packages (physical or electronic) being ordered by a library from a vendor.|
| |Organization|Any institution with whom your library interacts (this may or may not be an institution from whom you purchase materials).|

| |Parent record|The main link in a bound-with situation: It will have an item record (and thus barcode) that all other bibliographic records associated with a given bound-with volume can link to. Child records are those associated bibliographic records. Child records will have LKR fields in the bibliographic record that include the ADM number of the parent record and "Enum. Level.1" information found in the parent record's item record. Doing this allows all item record information in the parent record to display in the child record, so the same barcode, sublibrary, collection, description, call number, etc. will show up for all titles in a bound-with.|

| |Service point|A service point in FOLIO is a setting that libraries configure to support circulation functions. Every FOLIO item must have a location, and every location must have an attached service point. You must set up at least one service point to be able to check items in and out; allow patrons to request items; charge and collect fines; and put items in transit between locations at your library.|
| |Shelving lag time|Locally determined time-frame between the return of material and the time it should be reshelved. This functionality is not yet in place for FOLIO.|
